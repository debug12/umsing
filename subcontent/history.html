<p class="style2">About Us</p>
<p class="style4">The Michigan A Cappella Council was created during the Fall of 2002 by  Arts at Michigan, to provide members of the a cappella community the  opportunity to discuss various issues including: MACfest, joint  concerts, various collaborations, marketing ideas, and new project  ideas. Currently, there are twelve student a cappella groups  participating in the council.</p>
<p class="style4"><strong>Goals:</strong> The purpose of the Michigan A cappella Council  is to serve the a cappella music community on the University of  Michigan campus and provide a collective voice for campus a cappella  groups. This organization is dedicated to utilizing its resources to  foster learning experiences, services, provide a forum for discussion,  and a sense of a greater a cappella community especially by the  production of collaborative events, including A cappella Rush and the  Michigan A cappella Festival.</p>
<p class="style4"><strong>Meetings:</strong> The a cappella council meets at the Arts at  Michigan office every other Tuesday evening to unify and promote the U  of M a cappella community. Representatives of each of the groups and  the executive staff meet to discuss current collaborations and future  ideas.</p>
<p class="style4"><strong>MACFest : </strong>Michigan A Cappella Council coordinates the  largest a cappella performance on campus, MACFest. It is a magnificent  concert showcasing all/most of the a cappella groups on campus. This  year, the 8th annual MACFest concert will be held at the Rackham  Auditorium on the night of November 5th, 2011 at 7:00pm. Tickets can be bought at  MUTO.</p>
